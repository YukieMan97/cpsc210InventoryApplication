# inventoryApplication
S2019 - CPSC 210
A simple application that keeps track of information of items, such as its name, price, quantitiy, etc. within the store. 

I have classes of specific items and other categories a store would include. For example, I have a class of manga 
and art books which both extend Book which extends Item. Although there are multiple classes, cohesion and coupling 
are maintained under control.

Throughout the course, I first worked on building the user interface. In the last week of course, I implemented the GUI, 
which is why it is underdeveloped.

In the future, I would like to recreate an improved version of this application. It was very fun learning how to create a 
useful application. For now, I would like to use my knowledge and create different applications.
